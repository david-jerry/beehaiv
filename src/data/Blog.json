Whether you're building a simple static site or a complex application, Next.js has you covered.\n\nIf you're just starting with Next.js, take it one step at a time, and don't hesitate to refer to the official [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more information.\n\n## About the Author\n\n![Jane Doe](/images/authors/jane-doe.jpg)\n\nJane Doe is a seasoned web developer with expertise in JavaScript and modern web frameworks.
